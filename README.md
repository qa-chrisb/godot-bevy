# godot-bevy

`godot-bevy` is a Rust library that brings [Bevy's](https://bevyengine.org/) powerful Entity Component System (ECS) to the versatile [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Use Bevy's ergonomic and high-performance Rust ECS within your Godot projects to get the best of both worlds.

## Features

- **Deep ECS Integration**: True Bevy ECS systems controlling Godot nodes, not just bindings
- **Bidirectional Transform Sync**: Seamless Transform2D/3D synchronization between Bevy and Godot
- **Godot Signals in ECS**: Listen to and respond to Godot signals from Bevy systems
- **Collision Event Handling**: React to Godot collision events in your ECS systems
- **Scene Tree Queries**: Query and manipulate Godot's scene tree from Bevy
- **Resource Management**: Load and manage Godot resources (scenes, textures, etc.) from ECS
- **Node Groups Integration**: Work with Godot node groups in your Bevy systems
- **Smart Scheduling**: Physics-rate vs visual-rate system execution with proper timing
- **Godot Input Events**: Thread-safe Godot input events delivered as Bevy Events

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
godot-bevy = "0.4.0"
bevy = { version = "0.16", default-features = false }
godot = "0.2.4"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_systems(Update, handle_button_clicks)
        .add_systems(PhysicsUpdate, move_player);
}

// React to Godot UI signals in your ECS
fn handle_button_clicks(mut events: EventReader<GodotSignal>) {
    for signal in events.read() {
        if signal.name == "pressed" {
            println!("Button clicked! Entity: {:?}", signal.origin);
        }
    }
}

// Move player with physics timing
fn move_player(
    mut player: Query<(&Player, &mut Transform2D)>,
    mut system_delta: SystemDeltaTimer,
) {
    if let Ok((player_data, mut transform)) = player.single_mut() {
        let mut velocity = Vector2::ZERO;
        
        if Input::singleton().is_action_pressed("move_right") {
            velocity.x += 1.0;
        }
        if Input::singleton().is_action_pressed("move_left") {
            velocity.x -= 1.0;
        }
        
        if velocity.length() > 0.0 {
            velocity = velocity.normalized() * player_data.speed;
            transform.origin += velocity * system_delta.delta_seconds();
        }
    }
}
```

### Project Setup

1. **Add a `BevyAppSingleton` autoload** in your Godot project settings, which is a Godot scene containing a single root node of type BevyApp, which you can see examples of in `examples/`.
2. **Interact with Godot from Bevy**:

```rust
fn spawn_godot_scene(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn(GodotScene::from_path("res://my_scene.tscn")
        .with_translation3d(Vector3::new(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)));
}
```

## Documentation

### Core Concepts
- **[Timing and Schedules](docs/TIMING_AND_SCHEDULES.md)** - Understanding frame timing, schedule execution, and data synchronization
- **[Input Systems](docs/INPUT_SYSTEMS.md)** - Choosing between Bevy's built-in input and Godot's bridged input system

### API Reference
For detailed API documentation, see [docs.rs/godot-bevy](https://docs.rs/godot-bevy).

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains complete sample projects demonstrating different aspects of godot-bevy:

- **[`dodge-the-creeps-2d/`](examples/dodge-the-creeps-2d/)**: A complete 2D game showing ECS-driven gameplay, collision handling, and state management
- **[`timing-test/`](examples/timing-test/)**: Demonstrates the timing behavior and schedule execution patterns for debugging and understanding
- **[`input-event-demo/`](examples/input-event-demo/)**: Shows the thread-safe input event system and cross-platform input handling

Each example includes both Rust code and a complete Godot project ready to run.

## Inspiration and Acknowledgements

This library is inspired by and builds upon the work of [bevy_godot](https://github.com/rand0m-cloud/bevy_godot), which provided similar functionality for Godot 3. `godot-bevy` extends this concept to support Godot 4 and Bevy 0.16.

**Alternative**: If you're looking for a different approach to `godot-bevy`, check out [bevy_godot4](https://github.com/jrockett6/bevy_godot4). For a comparison of the differences between these libraries, see [Issue #2](https://github.com/dcvz/godot-bevy/issues/2).
